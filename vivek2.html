			<h2>Rohit Sharma is getting all the credit and acclaim he deserves for leading India to the ICC World Cup 2023 final. Rohit's performance in the existing competition has been one of the most important factors in India's path to the impending epic final on November 19 in Ahmedabad. 

India defeated New Zealand in the first semi-final match on Wednesday in Mumbai, and once again, Rohit's quickfire start to help India record a massive total made a big difference. Rohit's batting performance and leadership abilities have wowed everyone as India looks to win a trophy on Sunday.</h2>
